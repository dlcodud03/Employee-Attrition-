# Preditive Modeling of Employee Attrition 
This repository contains the complete project on Predictive Modeling of Employee Attrition. The objective of this project was to analyze a real-world dataset of employee records and predict potential attrition using various machine learning models.

Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

1. python_proj.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains all the Python code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The notebook provides a step-by-step breakdown of the entire analysis process, utilizing machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
2. Python_Proj.pptx - A presentation summarizing the project, including key findings, visualizations, and results from the predictive modeling. This slide deck is designed to provide a high-level overview of the methodology, insights, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
3. report python proj.pdf - A detailed report explaining the project in-depth. The report includes sections on problem definition, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model selection, and results interpretation. It also outlines the implications of the findings and potential recommendations based on the results.
4. annotated-Python_Proj-1.pdf - An annotated version of the Jupyter Notebook, with detailed comments explaining the code and its purpose. This file is intended for those who want a deeper understanding of the code logic and implementation.

Project Summary

The purpose of this project was to predict employee attrition using a real-world dataset. The analysis involved several key steps:

1. Data Wrangling and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and transforming variables for model training.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and analyzing key trends and relationships in the dataset to gain insights.
3. Model Building: Training multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the models based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Findings and Recommendations: Summarizing the key findings and providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
